        <h3>My Journey into Web Development</h3>
        <p class="post-meta">Published on September 12, 2025</p>
        <p>It started as a means for me to get money. I told myself that it was better than my other options so far. I learned HTML then CSS. I tried learning JavaScript early but that was more than i could take at the time.</p>

        <h3>The Intersection of Art and Code</h3>
        <p class="post-meta">Published on September 12, 2025</p>
        <p>Learning CSS made all the thinking worth it. It made me mix my art with code. I could clearly see the result of each line of code and how it interracted with other lines. CSS really helped me use my design logic to come up with beautiful projects.</p>
